# READ
read the original qc71_laptop readme (by pobrn)

basically i just removed all the checks of device id, bios version etc. That will make it work on some of the other intel laptops like mine maibenben x568 but ofc **its dangerous as hell dont ever do this it actually may damage ur laptop w\ a pretty nice chances**

# what actually works

fan speed in lm-sensors (was working in original repo)

led lightbar can actually change colors

battery treshhold kinda tries to work

# not working (yet?)

fan control (check out my fanctl2 repo tho)

fn lock, meta lock (why?...)

theyre both giving permission denied error which i bet i can also remove but i dont need these both functions so
